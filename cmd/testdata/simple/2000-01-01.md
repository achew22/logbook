Today I did stuff and things.

Tomorrow: I will finish the thing I forgot to do.

It is easy to accidenally screw up your paragraphs and fail to create a new
text node. We should parse each line of text in a paragraph to see if it has
an intentionally embedded non-new paragraph note for a datespec.
tomorrow: make paragraphs smarter. This is some filler text to make sure that
when a reminder spans to multiple lines it is included in its entirety.
tomorrow: you might even have two in one paragraph block.
